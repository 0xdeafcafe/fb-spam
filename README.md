Another installment in my series of hacks that will make your friends hate you.

### Getting a Facebook `access_token`

Go to the Facebook [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) and click `Get Access 
Token`, tick all the boxes and press `Get Access Token`. Allow it access to your account in the OAuth Modal, and 
a nice access_token will be displayed in the text box at the top of the page.
